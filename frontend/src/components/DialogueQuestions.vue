        <li>What does your facade look like? Might there be a reason that you percieve these traits within you, while your peers do not? Do you believe that you express those traits to your peers? Or could it be the case that the traits do not apply?</li>
        <li>Are there any unknown traits that may apply to you, that neither you or your peers have identified?</li>
        <li>Do you and your peers think about these traits in the same way? What does it mean for someone to be Kind? Or Warm? Did the semantics of the adjectives influence your choices? Did the semantics hold you back from not picking a trait?</li>

        <li>Are there any unknown traits that may apply to the subject that the group has not identified?</li>
